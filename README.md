# Docker image for building Chromaprint packages

This Docker image based on [manylinux2010](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/) is used for
AcoustID's builds of [FFmpeg](https://github.com/acoustid/ffmpeg-build) and
[Chromaprint](https://github.com/acoustid/chromaprint). It uses an old Linux system with the intention of having
the binaries usable on many different Linux distributions.
